1) I don't think I would use a unit test to test a message feature since it would require much more components than question 2 with the max message length. Therefore I don't think it's efficient to do a unit test for a message feature. Testing integrations sounds a lot better to test rather than unit testing.

2) Yes, I believe I would use a unit test to test the max message length since it's something that is defined but also isolated therefore making sure that the users cannot type more than like 80 characters rather than something a lot more over that amount. It could be tested with specific inputs/outputs that would make it a lot more ideal for unit testing compared to the first example you gave us students for the lab.
